How did I get involved with programing?
 - Just getting started really. I think this will be a good tool for product development ideas.

What are my goals with programing?
 - Again, just getting started but would like to develop applications for my current industry (aerospace) and use software as a service to replace much obsolete systems and tools currently used in air travel.
